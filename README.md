The project is intentionally kept this simple, meant for development purposes only.

## Getting started ##

### 1. Git clone the repository ###

You can fork or download the boilerplate from GitHub:

```
https://github.com/klikk/html-project-starter.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies ###

You need to have node with npm installed

```
npm install
```

### 3. Build the project ###

```
gulp
```

This command will run every gulp task:

- It will generate the CSS files from SCSS
- It will copy the images
- It will copy the JS files

You may run each task independently as well:

```
gulp sass
gulp scripts
gulp copy-images
```
